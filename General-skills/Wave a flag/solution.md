I downloaded the file via 'wget' and used 'exiftool' to see if there were any hints given.

Didnt find anythin useful here.

Using strings:

```
strings warm | grep -in picoCTF{
```

we get the flag:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a292262-a2c6-445b-97c7-a191836c7d44)


Flag:
```
picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
```


*****Alternate method:*****

Since this file is an executable file we run it.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/449fcf09-66c1-4770-8709-7a8eb5e0fe12)

```
chmod +x warm
./warm
```

Upon this we get this prompt:

Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!

```
./warm -h
```

Voila we get the flag:

Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
