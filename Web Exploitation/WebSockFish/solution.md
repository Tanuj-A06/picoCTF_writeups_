Viewing the source code we understand that an eval function is running:

Trying it out for ourselfs on the console:

Ok intresting, lets try eval function:

It appears as we increase the eval's integer input the fish inches towards victory, trying it with '0':

This shows that 'eval' function actually is showing the relative position of winning with positive values in the fish's favour.

Now slowly decreasing the value:

as the score decreases the fish resigns giving us the flag.


NOTE:

If you manage to defeat the fish in the game of chess, it wont yield the flag.
