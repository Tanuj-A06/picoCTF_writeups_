# Solution
- Upon visiting the website we are greeted with the login page:

  #### Throughts:
  - SQLinjection
  
    Tried various combinations of generelly used injections to try and crack the login page, yet the page did not yeild.

  - Check the source code  (Next approach)
    
      The index.js could be helpful:

      index.js:
      The condition for correct password looks intresting
    
      ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3621bd5-9433-44aa-8437-800395b2f9ac)

      Dcoding the base64 encoded password
      ```
      echo 'cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ' | base64 -d
      ```

      We get our flag:
    
      **picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}**
